                    <p>
                        My name is Violet Jessop and I’m from Bahía Blanca, Argentina. When I was a 
                        child I contracted tuberculosis, which despite doctors' predictions, I survived.
                        <br><br>
                        At 16 years old, my father died due to complications from surgery and my family
                        moved to England, where I attended a convent school and cared for my youngest 
                        sister while my mother was at sea working as a stewardess.
                        <br><br>
                        When my mother became ill, I left school and, following in my mother's footsteps,
                        applied to be a stewardess. Obtaining my first stewardess position with the Royal Mail 
                        Line aboard the Orinoco in 1908, I worked in the same field consistently until 
                        retirement in 1950.

                            In 1911 I began working as a stewardess for the White 
                            Star vessel RMS Olympic. Olympic was a luxury ship that
                            was the largest civilian liner at the time. 
                            <br><br>
                            In addition to this, the RMS Olympic held the status of
                            being the lead ship of the White Star Line's trio of 
                            Olympic-class liners. The Olympic-class ocean liners 
                            included the Olympic (1911), Titanic (1912), and 
                            Britannic (1915).
                            <br><br>
                            I was on board on 20 September 1911, when Olympic left 
                            from Southampton and collided with the British warship 
                            HMS Hawke. Thankfully there were no fatalities, and 
                            despite considerable damage the ship was able to make 
                            it back to port without sinking.

                            I boarded the RMS Titanic as a stewardess on 10 April 1912, 
                            at age 24. Four days later, on 14 April, it struck an iceberg
                            in the North Atlantic, where Titanic sank about two hours 
                            and forty minutes after the collision.
                            <br><br>
                            After fulfilling my duties I was ordered into lifeboat 16, 
                            and as the boat was being lowered one of Titanic's officers
                            entrusted me a baby to look after. The next morning, the rest
                            of the survivors and I were rescued by the RMS Carpathia.

                            During the First World War, I served as a nurse with the 
                            British Red Cross. On the morning of 21 November 1916, I was
                            on board HMHS Britannic, a White Star Liner that had been 
                            converted into a hospital ship, when it sank in the Aegean 
                            Sea after striking a deep sea mine.
                            <br><br>
                            Britannic sank within 55 minutes, killing 30 of the 1,066 
                            people on board. While Britannic was sinking, myself and
                            other passengers were nearly killed by the ship's propellers 
                            that were sucking lifeboats under the stern. In order to 
                            survive I was forced to jump out of my lifeboat, resulting
                            in a traumatic head injury which I ALSO survived.
                            <br><br>
                            I returned to work for the White Star Line in 1920.

                            safety equipment. As demonstrated in the past, I am able to
